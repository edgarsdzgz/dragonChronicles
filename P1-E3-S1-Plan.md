# P1-E3-S1 Planning Document

## Issue Analysis

**Story**: P1-E3-S1: Dragon Health System
**Epic**: P1-E3 (Dragon Combat System)
**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: 3 story points
**Dependencies**: P1-E2-S2 (Basic AI State Machine) âœ… Complete

### Current State
- Enemy spawning and AI systems are complete and working
- Core determinism engine is in place
- We need to implement the dragon's health system to enable combat

### Requirements Summary
- Dragon must have health points (HP) that decrease when taking damage
- **Death/Respawn Logic**: When dragon health reaches 0:
  - Clear all projectiles and enemies from screen
  - Dragon enters "idle" mode
  - Health bar progressively recovers from 0% to 100%
  - During recovery, dragon loses journey distance (pushback effect)
  - Once health is fully restored, enemies resume spawning and attacking
  - Journey continues automatically (no Arcana lost)
- Health system integrates with damage calculation
- Health state persists during combat sessions
- **Journey End**: Only occurs when player manually hits "Return to Draconia"

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Health System
1. **Create Health Types and Interfaces**
   - Define `DragonHealth` interface
   - Create health-related type definitions
   - Set up health configuration options

2. **Implement Health Manager**
   - Create `DragonHealthManager` class
   - Implement HP tracking and damage application
   - Add death detection and pushback respawn logic
   - Implement progressive health recovery system
   - Add distance pushback calculation based on land/ward levels

3. **Integration Points**
   - Connect with existing enemy AI system
   - Integrate with journey distance tracking
   - Implement pushback distance calculation
   - Set up health state persistence
   - Connect with projectile/enemy clearing system

### Phase 2: Testing and Validation
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Health state management tests
   - Damage application tests
   - Death/respawn logic tests
   - Performance tests

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Health system with enemy AI
   - State persistence verification
   - Performance under load

### Phase 3: Documentation and Cleanup
1. **Code Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Update architecture documentation
   - Create usage examples

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Ensure health updates are efficient
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Validate performance targets

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Health system updates could affect frame rate
- **State Persistence**: Health state might not persist correctly across sessions

### Medium Risk
- **Integration Complexity**: Connecting with existing systems might be complex
- **Death Logic**: Respawn mechanics might need careful tuning

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early Performance Testing**: Test health updates under load
- **Incremental Integration**: Connect systems gradually
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit and integration tests
- **State Validation**: Verify persistence at each step

## Pushback Distance Calculation

### Research Findings
Based on research of Unnamed Space Idle and similar idle games, the pushback mechanic should:

1. **Base Pushback Distance**: Start with a fixed base distance (e.g., 100-200 meters)
2. **Land/Ward Modifiers**: Higher land and ward levels reduce pushback distance
3. **Progressive Recovery**: Health recovery time correlates with pushback distance
4. **Minimum Pushback**: Ensure minimum pushback to maintain challenge

### Proposed Formula
```typescript
// Base pushback distance (meters)
const BASE_PUSHBACK = 150;

// Land and ward influence factors
const LAND_FACTOR = 0.1;  // 10% reduction per land level
const WARD_FACTOR = 0.05; // 5% reduction per ward level

// Calculate pushback distance
function calculatePushbackDistance(landLevel: number, wardLevel: number): number {
  const landReduction = landLevel * LAND_FACTOR;
  const wardReduction = wardLevel * WARD_FACTOR;
  const totalReduction = Math.min(landReduction + wardReduction, 0.8); // Max 80% reduction
  
  const pushbackDistance = BASE_PUSHBACK * (1 - totalReduction);
  return Math.max(pushbackDistance, 20); // Minimum 20 meters pushback
}
```

### Recovery Time Calculation
```typescript
// Health recovery time (seconds)
const RECOVERY_TIME = 8; // 8 seconds to fully recover

// Pushback rate (meters per second)
function calculatePushbackRate(pushbackDistance: number): number {
  return pushbackDistance / RECOVERY_TIME;
}
```

## Technical Architecture

  startRecovery(pushbackDistance: number): void;
  updateRecovery(deltaTime: number): void;
  respawn(): void;
}
```

class DragonHealthManager {
  private health: DragonHealth;
  private config: HealthConfig;
  private landLevel: number;
  private wardLevel: number;

  update(deltaTime: number): void;
  takeDamage(amount: number): void;
  heal(amount: number): void;
