# 19 — Premium Currency: Astral Seals

## Overview

**Astral Seals** are the premium currency of Draconia Chronicles, serving as the game's equivalent of "Gems" in other mobile titles, but rooted in **Draconia's cosmic lore** rather than simple wealth or ancestry. This ensures they retain a **premium feel** without cheapening honor, ancestry, or traditions.

### Core Philosophy

- **Category:** Premium Currency

- **Availability:** Rare in-game acquisition + optional purchase with real money

- **Lore Integration:** Cosmic fragments representing petitions to divine forces

- **Not Pay-to-Win:** Accelerates progress but not required to complete the game

## Lore & Mythology

### Origin Flame

The legends tell of the **First Flame** — a primordial spark that ignited both the stars
above
and
dragonfire
below..
This Flame fractured, scattering into shards that became the **Origin Shards**, drifting
across
the
cosmos.

### Sealing of the Skies

When the gods raised the Dragonlands against chaos, they bound fragments of the cosmos
into
radiant
tokens
called
**Astral
Seals**..
Each Seal was impressed with a divine "signature," a mark of the gods' authority over
creation.

### The Comet Showers

In later ages, dragons discovered that when comets passed Draconia, they shed **Starlit
Shards**
—
radiant
fragments
that
rained
down
as
meteors..
Rarely, within these meteors, a true **Astral Seal** could be uncovered: brighter, rarer,
and
filled
with
destiny.

### Modern Role

Today, Astral Seals remain both mystical relics and functional currency..
Dragons see them as fragments of cosmic power, **petitioning the gods themselves**, not as
buying
honor.
Spending one is akin to bending the memory of the stars toward your destiny.

## Visual Identity

### Core Look

## Gameplay Integration

### Acquisition Methods

- **Balanced Power:** Premium items provide advantages but don't break game balance

#### Scarcity Design

- **Rare In-Game:** Astral Seals must feel rare — earned slowly in-game

#### Prestige Elements

- **Cosmic Lore:** Seals represent cosmic power, not mere wealth

- **Divine Connection:** Spending feels like petitioning the gods

- **Destiny Shaping:** Premium purchases align with cosmic forces

## Rune Gachapon System

### Gacha Mechanics

````typescript

interface RuneGacha {
  cost: number;              // Astral Seals per draw
  rarityWeights: number[];   // Probability distribution
  pitySystem: PityConfig;    // Guaranteed rare after X draws
  seasonalPool: Rune[];      // Limited-time runes
}

interface PityConfig {
  rareGuarantee: 10;    // Guaranteed rare every 10 draws
  epicGuarantee: 50;    // Guaranteed epic every 50 draws
  legendaryGuarantee: 200; // Guaranteed legendary every 200 draws
}

```javascript

### Rune Rarity System

```typescript

enum RuneRarity {
  COMMON = 1,      // 60% chance
  UNCOMMON = 2,    // 25% chance
  RARE = 3,        // 12% chance
  EPIC = 4,        // 2.5% chance
  LEGENDARY = 5    // 0.5% chance
}

interface Rune {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  rarity: RuneRarity;
  effects: RuneEffect[];
  description: string;
  lore: string;
}

```javascript

### Pity System Implementation

```typescript

interface PityTracker {
  currentDraws: number;
  lastRareDraw: number;
  lastEpicDraw: number;
  lastLegendaryDraw: number;
}

function calculateDrawResult(pity: PityTracker): RuneResult {
  // Check pity guarantees first
  if (pity.currentDraws - pity.lastLegendaryDraw >= 200) {
    return { rarity: RuneRarity.LEGENDARY, pityTriggered: true };
  }
  if (pity.currentDraws - pity.lastEpicDraw >= 50) {
    return { rarity: RuneRarity.EPIC, pityTriggered: true };
  }
  if (pity.currentDraws - pity.lastRareDraw >= 10) {
    return { rarity: RuneRarity.RARE, pityTriggered: true };
  }

  // Normal probability calculation
  return { rarity: calculateRandomRarity(), pityTriggered: false };
}

```text

## Lab Expansion System

### Slot Expansion

```typescript

interface LabExpansion {
  baseSlots: 1;           // Starting research slots
  maxSlots: 5;           // Maximum purchasable slots
  expansionCost: number[]; // Cost per additional slot
  queueExpansion: number[]; // Queue capacity increases
}

const labExpansionCosts = {
  slot2: 50,   // Astral Seals
  slot3: 150,
  slot4: 300,
  slot5: 500,

  queue2: 25,  // Additional queue slots
  queue3: 75,
  queue4: 150,
  queue5: 250
};

```javascript

### Benefits of Expansion

- **Parallel Research:** Multiple research projects simultaneously

- **Queue Management:** More research queued for later execution

- **Efficiency Gains:** Faster progression through research trees

- **Strategic Flexibility:** More options for research prioritization

## Rune Slot System

### Slot Expansion (2)

```typescript

interface RuneSlotExpansion {
  baseSlots: 3;           // Starting rune slots
  maxSlots: 8;           // Maximum purchasable slots
  expansionCost: number[]; // Cost per additional slot
}

const runeSlotCosts = {
  slot4: 100,   // Astral Seals
  slot5: 250,
  slot6: 500,
  slot7: 750,
  slot8: 1000
};

```javascript

### Rune Equipment Benefits

- **Passive Bonuses:** Permanent stat improvements

- **Active Abilities:** Special powers and effects

- **Synergy Effects:** Combinations between different runes

- **Build Customization:** Personalize dragon capabilities
