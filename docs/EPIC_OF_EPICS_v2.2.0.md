# 🐉 DRACONIA CHRONICLES v2.2.0 - EPIC OF EPICS

**Version:** 2.2.0
**Date:** 2025-01-12
**Status:** Comprehensive Development Plan
**Based on:** v2.2 GDD + Complete Tome Documentation

---

## Executive Summary

This Epic of Epics breaks down the complete Draconia Chronicles v2.2.0 implementation into
**individual,
manageable
components**
that
can
be
developed
and
tested
separately..
Each epic represents a complete feature or system that can be implemented, tested, and
integrated
independently.

**Key Principles:**

- **Frontend Phase Separation:** All frontend components developed individually in dedicated phase

- **Component Isolation:** Each story represents a single, testable component

- **No Automation:** Manual development and testing for quality control

- **Incremental Integration:** Build and test each piece before combining
