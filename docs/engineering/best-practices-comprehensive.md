project.

## 1. Code Organization and Architecture

### 1.1 Fundamental Principles

#### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class/module should have one reason to change

- **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification

- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes

- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use

- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

#### Clean Code Principles

- **Meaningful Names**: Use intention-revealing, searchable, pronounceable names

- **Small Functions**: Functions should be small and do one thing well

- **Comments**: Explain why, not what; prefer expressive code over comments

- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions rather than return codes; don't return null

- **Formatting**: Consistent formatting aids readability

### 1.2 Project Structure Standards

#### Monorepo Organization (pnpm workspaces)

````bash

project-root/
├── packages/           # Shared libraries
│   ├── shared/        # Common utilities and types
│   ├── logger/        # Logging system
│   ├── db/           # Database layer
│   └── sim/          # Game simulation
├── apps/             # Applications

│   └── sandbox/      # Development tools
├── docs/             # Documentation hub
├── tests/            # Test suites
└── scripts/          # Automation tools

```text

#### Package Boundaries

- **Clear Responsibilities**: Each package has a single, well-defined purpose

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce coupling between packages

- **Stable Interfaces**: Package APIs should be stable and well-documented

- **Version Management**: Use workspace protocols for internal dependencies

### 1.3 TypeScript Best Practices

#### Type Safety

- **Strict Mode**: Always enable TypeScript strict mode

- **Explicit Types**: Prefer explicit type annotations for public APIs

- **Generic Constraints**: Use generic constraints to improve type safety

- **Utility Types**: Leverage TypeScript utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial, etc.)

#### Code Organization

- **Barrel Exports**: Use index files to create clean package interfaces

- **Type-Only Imports**: Use `import type` for type-only imports

- **Namespace Organization**: Group related types and utilities in namespaces

- **Declaration Files**: Provide `.d.ts` files for JavaScript modules

## 2. Game Development Specific Practices

### 2.1 Architecture Patterns

#### Entity Component System (ECS)

- **Entities**: Simple containers with unique IDs

- **Components**: Pure data structures

- **Systems**: Logic that operates on entities with specific components

- **Benefits**: Performance, flexibility, maintainability

#### Game Loop Patterns

- **Fixed Timestep**: Consistent simulation regardless of frame rate

- **Variable Timestep**: Smooth rendering with frame rate compensation

- **Hybrid Approach**: Fixed simulation with variable rendering

#### State Management

- **State Machines**: Clear state transitions for game objects

- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulate game actions for undo/redo functionality

- **Observer Pattern**: Decouple game systems through event-driven architecture

### 2.2 Performance Considerations

#### Memory Management

- **Object Pooling**: Reuse objects to reduce garbage collection

- **Memory Profiling**: Regular monitoring of memory usage patterns

- **Asset Loading**: Lazy loading and streaming for large assets

- **Cache Optimization**: Minimize memory allocations in hot paths

#### Rendering Optimization

- **Batch Operations**: Group similar rendering operations

- **Level of Detail**: Reduce complexity for distant objects

- **Culling**: Don't render objects outside the viewport

- **Texture Management**: Optimize texture sizes and formats
