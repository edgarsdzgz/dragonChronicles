## Contributing to Documentation

All code changes that affect packages, apps, or tests require corresponding documentation
updates.

### Planning Document Standards

- **All planning documents** must be created in the `/docs/` folder

- **Workpack plans** (W7, W8, etc.) go directly in `/docs/` folder

- **Feature plans** go in appropriate subdirectories within `/docs/`

- **No planning documents** should be created in the root directory
