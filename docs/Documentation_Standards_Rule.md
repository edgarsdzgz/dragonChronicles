// What this does: Calculates the Shield Tax based on total Arcana and legendary status
// Why this exists: Provides fair taxation that rewards player progression
// How it integrates: Called by Return to Draconia system when processing return
class ShieldTaxCalculator {
  calculateShieldTax(
    totalArcana: number,        // Total Arcana earned in journey
    legendaryStatus: number = 0 // Player's legendary status (affects tax reduction)
  ): ShieldTaxCalculation {
    const baseTaxRate = 0.25; // 25% base tax - this is the standard rate
const legendaryReduction = Math.min(legendaryStatus * 0.01, 0.15); // Max 15% reduction
const effectiveTaxRate = baseTaxRate - legendaryReduction; // Final rate after reductions
    const taxAmount = Math.floor(totalArcana * effectiveTaxRate); // Actual tax amount
    const arcanaRetained = totalArcana - taxAmount; // Arcana player keeps

    // Returns complete tax calculation for UI display and persistence
    return {
      totalArcana, baseTaxRate, legendaryReduction,
      effectiveTaxRate, taxAmount, arcanaRetained
    };
  }
}

---

## üö´ **No Hardcoded Values Rule**

**MANDATORY:** All technical specifications must follow the **No Hardcoded Values Rule** as
defined in `docs/No*Hardcoded*Values_Rule.md`. Every numeric constant, duration, rate,
threshold, and configuration value that affects gameplay MUST be upgradeable through
player
progression systems. Test values are exempt and should use fixed values for reliability.

### **Key Requirements:**

- **Configuration-First Design:** All gameplay values stored in configuration objects

- **Upgrade System Integration:** Soul Power, tech trees, premium currency integration

- **Future-Proofing:** Modular upgrade interfaces for new parameters

- **No Magic Numbers:** All gameplay examples show both base and upgraded scenarios

- **Test Reliability:** Test values can be hardcoded for consistent, reliable testing

---

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

### **Documentation Quality Indicators:**

1. **Accessibility:** Non-technical team members can understand purpose and impact

1. **Completeness:** All hierarchical levels have required summaries

1. **Clarity:** Code examples are self-documenting with comments

1. **Integration:** Clear understanding of how components connect

1. **Actionability:** Clear completion criteria and deliverables

---

## üìù **Implementation Notes**

### **For LLM Onboarding:**

- This rule is MANDATORY for all AI assistants

- Every response creating or updating documentation MUST follow this structure

- Code examples MUST include comprehensive inline comments

- Summaries MUST be written for both technical and non-technical audiences

### **For Human Team Members:**
