# 🐉 DRACONIA CHRONICLES — v2.3.2 GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

**Version:** 2.3.2
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Status:** Comprehensive Technical Specification
**Canonical Precedence:** v2.2 GDD content integrated with Arcana Expansion v2.3.1 + Nested Triangle Elemental System

---

## Executive Summary

### 🎯 **What This Document Does**

**For Non-Coders:** This is the complete "bible" for Draconia Chronicles - a dragon-themed idle game where players journey through different areas, fight enemies, and build up their dragon's power. The game combines automatic combat with strategic progression, where players can upgrade their dragon permanently while also getting temporary boosts during each adventure. Version 2.3.1 introduces a major change: instead of losing all your magical currency (Arcana) when returning home, you now keep most of it but pay a small tax to help protect the city.

**Technical Summary:** This v2.3.1 GDD represents the ultimate technical bible for Draconia Chronicles, consolidating all design decisions, technical specifications, and implementation details into a comprehensive reference. It builds upon the v2.0 foundation and integrates v2.1 refinements while establishing the complete vision for the shooter-idle experience with persistent Arcana progression.

### 🏗️ **What We'll Have Completed After This GDD**

**For Non-Coders:** This document provides the complete blueprint for building Draconia Chronicles, including all the game mechanics, technical systems, and player progression features. It serves as the single source of truth for developers, designers, and stakeholders to understand exactly how the game works and what needs to be built.

**Technical Summary:** Complete technical specification covering core gameplay loops, economy systems, technical architecture, performance requirements, testing frameworks, and implementation details for all game systems.

### Key Integration Points

- **v2.0 Foundation:** Core shooter-idle loop, technical architecture, performance budgets

### TypeScript Implementation Stubs

```typescript

// What this does: Calculates the geometric cost progression for enchant upgrades
// Why this exists: Provides smooth, predictable cost scaling that prevents runaway
inflation
// How it integrates: Used by enchant system to determine upgrade costs
// Usage context: Called when player attempts to upgrade enchants during journey
export function costGeom(base: number, lvl: number, r = 1.12) {
  // base: starting cost for level 0
  // lvl: current level to calculate cost for
  // r: geometric ratio (default 1.12 = 12% increase per level)
return Math.floor(base * Math.pow(r, lvl)); // Apply geometric progression and round down
}

// What this does: Calculates the difficulty multiplier when entering a new ward
// Why this exists: Provides significant difficulty jumps between areas to maintain
challenge
// How it integrates: Used by enemy scaling system to increase stats when advancing wards
// Usage context: Called when player crosses ward boundaries during journey
export function wardBump(ward: number, mult = 1, bump = 1.22) {
  // ward: current ward number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
  // mult: base multiplier (usually 1.0)
  // bump: ward difficulty increase factor (default 1.22 = 22% increase per ward)
  return mult * Math.pow(bump, ward - 1); // Apply ward-based difficulty scaling
}

// What this does: Calculates enemy difficulty micro-ramps within a ward based on distance
// Why this exists: Provides gradual difficulty increase to maintain engagement without
sudden
jumps
// How it integrates: Used by enemy spawning system to scale individual enemy stats
// Usage context: Called continuously during journey to update enemy difficulty
export function microRamp(distM: number, stepM: number, inc = 0.01) {
  // distM: current distance traveled in meters
  // stepM: distance interval for each micro-ramp (e.g., every 5 meters)
  // inc: difficulty increase per step (default 0.01 = 1% increase)
  return 1 + Math.floor(distM / stepM) * inc; // Calculate total difficulty multiplier
}

### Dragon Elemental System

#### Nested Triangle System Overview
The dragon's breath weapon system uses a **nested triangle system** with three main categories, each containing three sub-elements that follow their own internal triangle relationships.

#### Meta-Triangle (Main Categories)
```
Heat > Cold > Energy > Heat
```

**Category Relationships:**
- **Heat beats Cold**: Fire melts ice, steam defrosts, lava vaporizes frost
- **Cold beats Energy**: Ice insulates electricity, frost grounds lightning, cold slows energy
- **Energy beats Heat**: Lightning disrupts fire, electricity conducts through heat, energy cuts through thermal systems

#### Sub-Triangles (Internal Elements)

##### **Heat Triangle: Fire > Lava > Steam > Fire**
- **Fire**: Pure flame, burning damage, ignites enemies
- **Lava**: Molten rock, armor penetration, area denial
- **Steam**: Scorching vapor, area denial, concealment

**Internal Logic:**
- **Fire beats Lava**: Pure flame burns through molten rock
- **Lava beats Steam**: Molten rock vaporizes steam
- **Steam beats Fire**: Scorching vapor extinguishes flames

##### **Cold Triangle: Ice > Frost > Mist > Ice**
- **Ice**: Solid freezing, immobilization, armor shattering
- **Frost**: Slowing effects, brittleness, surface coating
- **Mist**: Concealment, confusion, area denial

**Internal Logic:**
- **Ice beats Frost**: Solid ice crushes frost
- **Frost beats Mist**: Frost crystallizes mist
- **Mist beats Ice**: Mist conceals and confuses ice attacks

##### **Energy Triangle: Lightning > Plasma > Void > Lightning**
- **Lightning**: Electrical damage, stunning, precision
- **Plasma**: Superheated energy, explosive, area effect
- **Void**: Dark energy, corruption, disruption

**Internal Logic:**
- **Lightning beats Plasma**: Electrical precision disrupts plasma
- **Plasma beats Void**: Superheated energy burns through void
- **Void beats Lightning**: Dark energy absorbs electrical attacks

#### Cross-Triangle Rules
- **Any Heat element beats any Cold element** (150% damage)
- **Any Cold element beats any Energy element** (150% damage)
- **Any Energy element beats any Heat element** (150% damage)
- **Within same triangle**: Follow internal A > B > C > A rules (150% damage)
- **Same element**: 100% damage (neutral)
- **Opposite triangle**: 75% damage (weakness)

#### Elemental Status Effects
```typescript
const ELEMENTAL_EFFECTS = {
  // Heat effects
  fire: { name: 'Burn', damage: '2% max HP per second', duration: '5 seconds' },
  lava: { name: 'Melt', damage: 'Reduces armor by 25%', duration: '8 seconds' },
  steam: { name: 'Scorch', damage: 'Reduces accuracy by 30%', duration: '6 seconds' },

  // Cold effects
  ice: { name: 'Freeze', damage: 'Immobilizes for 3 seconds', duration: '3 seconds' },
  frost: { name: 'Chill', damage: 'Reduces speed by 40%', duration: '8 seconds' },
  mist: { name: 'Blind', damage: 'Reduces accuracy by 50%', duration: '4 seconds' },

  // Energy effects
  lightning: { name: 'Stun', damage: 'Prevents actions for 2 seconds', duration: '2 seconds' },
  plasma: { name: 'Overheat', damage: 'Increases damage taken by 25%', duration: '6 seconds' },
  void: { name: 'Corrupt', damage: 'Prevents healing for 10 seconds', duration: '10 seconds' }
};
```

#### Land-Based Elemental Themes
```typescript
const LAND_ELEMENTAL_THEMES = {
  'Land 1: Horizon Steppe': {
    primary: 'cold',      // Wind-based enemies (ice, frost, mist)
    secondary: 'energy',  // Lightning-based enemies
    resistance: 'heat'    // Resistant to heat (dry, windy land)
  },
  'Land 2: Ember Reaches': {
    primary: 'heat',      // Fire-based enemies (fire, lava, steam)
    secondary: 'cold',    // Ice-based enemies (volcanic ice)
    resistance: 'energy'  // Resistant to energy (volcanic grounding)
  },
  'Land 3: Mistral Peaks': {
    primary: 'energy',    // Lightning-based enemies
    secondary: 'cold',    // Wind-based enemies (ice, frost, mist)
    resistance: 'heat'    // Resistant to heat (mountainous, cold)
  }
};
```

```

### Dragon Defeat & Pushback System

#### Defeat Mechanics
When the dragon's health reaches 0, the following sequence occurs:

1. **Immediate Effects**:
   - All projectiles and enemies are cleared from screen
   - Dragon enters "idle" mode (stops moving/attacking)
   - Dragon becomes invulnerable during recovery

2. **Progressive Health Recovery**:
   - Health bar progressively recovers from 0% to 100%
   - Recovery time scales with pushback percentage (6-12 seconds)
   - Dragon loses journey distance during recovery (pushback effect)

3. **Pushback Distance Calculation**:
   - Percentage-based system (3-15% of current distance)
   - Land difficulty spikes: New lands start with 3% (gentle)
   - Ward progression: Within each land, pushback increases to 15%
   - Never pushes back below distance 0

4. **Ward/Land Transitions**:
   - Pushback can move dragon to different ward/land
   - Example: L2W2 at 1000m, 6% pushback = 940m (L2W1)
   - Seamless transition between areas

5. **Journey Continuation**:
   - Journey continues automatically after recovery
   - No Arcana lost during defeat
   - Journey only ends when player manually returns to Draconia

#### Pushback Percentage Progression
```
Land 1: Horizon Steppe (Tutorial → Advanced)
├── Ward 1: 3% (Sunwake Downs - tutorial)
├── Ward 2: 5% (Waystone Mile - basic)
├── Ward 3: 7% (Skylark Flats - air combat)
├── Ward 4: 10% (Longgrass Reach - accuracy)
└── Ward 5: 12% (Bluewind Shelf - crosswind)

Land 2: Ember Reaches (Difficulty Spike!)
├── Ward 1: 3% (New land tutorial - gentle)
├── Ward 2: 6% (Fire basics)
├── Ward 3: 9% (Heat resistance)
├── Ward 4: 12% (Lava flows)
└── Ward 5: 15% (Ember mastery)

Land 3: Mistral Peaks (Difficulty Spike!)
├── Ward 1: 3% (New land tutorial - gentle)
├── Ward 2: 7% (Wind basics)
├── Ward 3: 11% (Ice resistance)
├── Ward 4: 14% (Storm peaks)
└── Ward 5: 15% (Summit mastery)
```

### Telemetry (Phase 1)

- `screen*view`, `journey*start/end`, `return*to*draconia`, `upgrade_purchase`

- `death`, `ability*used`, `offline*return`, `fps`

- **v2.3.1 Arcana Events:** `shield*tax*paid`, `arcana*deposited`, `transmutation*attempt`, `city*donation`, `barrier*power_invested`

---

## 4. Progression: Maps, Wards & Lands

### Structure

World → Lands → Wards → distance milestones..
Each Ward: micro-ramps and a gate (boss/mini-boss).

### Data Model

```typescript

export interface Land {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  wards: Ward[];
}

export interface Ward {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  distStepM: number;
  bump: number;
  bossId?: number;
}

```text

### Content Plan (Chapter 1 slice)

- **Lands:** 1–3 for MVP; each with ~10 Wards; miniboss every 5, boss every 10

- **Drops:** Arcana always; items (sell for Gold) occasionally; rare **Scrolls** (seed future moves)

- **Bosses:** elemental variants with simple ability pool; guaranteed chest on first clear

---

## 5. Combat Systems, Enemies & Bosses

### Dragon Combat System (P1-E3)

#### Dragon Health System (P1-E3-S1) ✅
- **Health Management**: Dragon HP with progressive recovery (6-12 seconds)
- **Pushback System**: Percentage-based pushback (3-15% by land/ward)
- **Elemental Triangle**: Nested elemental system (meta + sub-triangles)
- **Status Effects**: Burn, Freeze, Stun, and other elemental effects
- **Ward Transitions**: Seamless health state management across areas

#### Configurable Targeting System (P1-E3-S2) ✅
- **15+ Targeting Strategies**: Closest, highest threat, lowest threat, health-based, damage-based, speed-based, armor-based, shield-based, elemental-based
- **4 Persistence Modes**: Keep target, switch freely, switch aggressive, manual only
- **Player Customization**: Configurable targeting preferences with presets
- **Progressive Unlocks**: Level-based, achievement-based, and time-based strategy unlocks
- **Performance Optimized**: <0.1ms update time for 200+ enemies

### Enemy Archetypes

- **Swarm** (low HP, high count), **Ranged** (projectiles), **Shielded** (damage gates)

- **Spectral** (phase), **Chitin** (armor breakpoint)

### Boss Design

- Telegraph windows ("use ability now"), attempt/clear metrics, retreat rules

### Stats & Curves

```typescript

export interface EnemyFamily {
  id: number;
  baseHP: number;
  baseDMG: number;
  traits: string[];
}

export function enemyHP(base: number, ward: number, distM: number, bump = 1.18) {
  return Math.floor(base * Math.pow(bump, ward - 1));
}

```text

### Scaling & Cadence

- **HP:** `HP(n) = baseHP * 1.12^n` (normal), elites/bosses apply multipliers

- **DMG:** `DMG(n) = baseDMG * 1.10^n`

- **Ward bump:** step increase on entering each Ward; **micro-ramps** inside Ward: +x% every 5m (early), 10m (later)

- **Caps:** design for **200 active enemies** (spikes **400**) and **≤600 projectiles/s**

---

## 6. Abilities, Skills & Rituals

### Ability Framework

```typescript

export type AbilityId = number;

export interface AbilitySpec {
  id: AbilityId;
  name: string;
  cdMs: number;
  kind: 'burst' | 'dot' | 'utility';
}

export interface BuffSpec {
  id: number;
  durationMs: number;
  mods: {
    dmgMult?: number;
    aspd?: number;
  };
}

```text

### Manual Abilities ("moves")

- Tap-to-cast skills with **charges (PP)**/cooldowns; early examples: **Breath Burst**, **Wing Guard**, **Time Slip**

- Power-ups can grant temporary **infinite PP** windows for engagement spikes

### Manual Contribution Target

~20% ±10% pre-Rift damage from abilities

### Scrolls & Rituals

- Drops per Land; dupes → Scribe Ink; pity + targeted scribing

- Skills tree (smithing, mining) scaffolding (post-MVP hooks)

---

## 7. Economy: Currencies, Items, Market

### Currencies

- **Arcana** (persistent run currency), **Gold** (QoL), **Soul Power** (meta), **Astral Seals** (premium)

### Arcana Expansion (v2.3.1)

Arcana is now **persistent** across journeys and serves multiple purposes beyond temporary
enchants:

#### City of Draconia Investments

- **Civic Donations:** Contribute Arcana to expand housing, civic spires, and public works → grants permanent buffs (e.g., global +2% Arcana yield, faster lab research)

- **Barrier Power:** Direct Arcana into the Great Barrier → lore integration, occasional region events where player donations strengthen defenses

- **Guild/Apprentice Housing:** Unlock junior dragons, alchemists, or apprentices via Arcana-funded construction

#### Economy & Crafting

- **Synth Boosts:** Arcana temporarily accelerates Synth production, increases yield, or removes input costs for one cycle

- **Arcana Infusion:** Enchant crafted gear with temporary magical bonuses (e.g., "Arcana-forged Blade: +5% DMG for 1h")

- **Transmutation (Alchemist NPC):**

  - Combine Gold + Arcana → attempt to transform into rarer minerals (White Gold, Platinum, Azure/Black/Royal Platinum)

  - **Risk Factor:** chance of failure where Gold is consumed with no output. Higher Arcana input reduces risk but never removes it

  - **Design Goal:** Gambling-like tension balanced with meaningful long-term gains

#### Arcana Shield Bank

A dedicated **Arcana dumping system** for surplus currency:

- **Mechanic:** Players deposit Arcana into the Shield Bank. Deposits are permanent; withdrawn Arcana is not possible

- **Milestone Rewards:** Secrets/powers unlocked at specific thresholds:

  - 1,000, 10,000, 250,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 5,000,000, 10,000,000, 50,000,000, 250,000,000, 500,000,000 Arcana

  - (future milestones scale upward indefinitely)

- **Reward Philosophy:** Secrets TBD; may include unique powers, boosts, transformations, or major progression accelerators. Rewards should feel monumental and lore-significant

### Shield Tax System

To discourage journey spamming, Draconia levies a tax on dragons returning for shield
protection:

- **Base Tax:** 25% of total Arcana

- **Lore:** "These are the end times" - the tax is steep but necessary for the city's survival

- **Legendary Dragons:** Higher legendary status increases chance of tax reduction

- **Player Hint:** System tells players there are ways to reduce the tax, encouraging progression

### Item Model

```typescript

export enum Rarity {
  Common = 1,
  Uncommon = 2,
  Rare = 3,
  Epic = 4
}

export enum PriceBin {
  Low = 1,
  Fair = 2,
  High = 3
}

export interface Item {
  id: string;
  rarity: Rarity;
  baseVal: number;
}

```bash

### Market System

- **Taxed stalls** in early Market; open **owned shops** later to remove taxes at the cost of being "manned"

- **Hire clerks** (wage) for uptime; **Mercantile level** rises with sales, unlocking better margins/slots

- **City investments:** donate Arcana/Gold to expand housing and civic buildings for **permanent** global buffs

---

## 7.5. Arcana Expansion Implementation (v2.3.1)

### 🎯 **What This Section Does**

**For Non-Coders:** This section explains how the new Arcana system works in detail. Instead of losing all your magical currency when returning home, you now keep most of it and can use it for many different things: investing in the city to make it stronger, trying to turn regular gold into rare materials (with some risk), and depositing extra Arcana into a special bank that unlocks powerful rewards. The system also includes a tax when you return to the city (25% of your total Arcana) to help protect the city, but legendary dragons can reduce this tax.

**Technical Summary:** Implementation details for the Arcana Expansion v2.3.1 system including frontend UI components, backend state management, economy balancing, and narrative integration for persistent Arcana currency with Shield Tax system.

### Frontend Implementation

- **Svelte UI Components:**

  - Shield Bank interface with deposit animations and milestone progress bars

  - Alchemist transmutation interface with risk/reward visualization

  - City investment panels showing donation options and permanent buff previews

  - Shield Tax notification system with legendary status hints

### Backend/State Management

- **Dexie Schema Extensions:**

  ```typescript

  // What this does: Defines the data structure for storing Arcana Expansion progress
// Why this exists: Allows players to save their city investments, transmutation history,
and
legendary
status
// How it integrates: Extends the main Profile schema to track persistent Arcana-related
progress
// Usage context: Saved to IndexedDB whenever player makes Arcana-related purchases or
investments
  export interface ArcanaExpansionData {
shieldBankDeposited: number; // Total Arcana deposited into Shield Bank (permanent)
cityDonations: Record<string, number>; // Track donations by type (housing, civic, etc.)
barrierPower: number; // Total Arcana invested in Great Barrier
transmutationHistory: TransmutationAttempt[]; // History of all transmutation attempts
legendaryStatus: number; // Player's legendary status (affects Shield Tax)
  }

  // What this does: Records a single attempt to transmute gold into rare materials
  // Why this exists: Allows tracking success rates and provides history for UI display
  // How it integrates: Stored in ArcanaExpansionData.transmutationHistory array
  // Usage context: Created each time player attempts transmutation at Alchemist NPC
  export interface TransmutationAttempt {
    id: string;           // Unique identifier for this attempt
    timestamp: number;    // When the attempt was made (epoch ms)
    goldInput: number;    // Amount of gold used in attempt
    arcanaInput: number;  // Amount of Arcana used to reduce risk
    success: boolean;     // Whether transmutation succeeded
    output?: string;      // Type of rare material produced (if successful)
  }

```bash

### Economy Balancing

- **Shield Bank Thresholds:** Set at "round milestones" (1K, 10K, 250K, etc.) for psychological impact

- **Transmutation Success Curve:** Tuned to avoid runaway rare mineral generation

- **Shield Tax Calculation:**

  ```typescript

// What this does: Calculates the Shield Tax amount based on total Arcana and legendary
status
// Why this exists: Provides fair taxation that rewards player progression while funding
city
protection
// How it integrates: Called by Return to Draconia system when processing return from
journey
// Usage context: Used during return flow to determine how much Arcana player keeps vs
pays
as
tax
  function calculateShieldTax(totalArcana: number, legendaryStatus: number): number {
    const baseTax = 0.25; // 25% base tax rate - standard rate for all dragons
const legendaryReduction = Math.min(legendaryStatus * 0.01, 0.15); // max 15% reduction
from
legendary
status
const effectiveTax = baseTax - legendaryReduction; // Final tax rate after legendary
reduction
return Math.floor(totalArcana * effectiveTax); // Calculate actual tax amount (rounded
down)
  }

```javascript

### Narrative Integration

- **Codex Secrets:** Tied to donation milestones, revealing lore about Draconia's history

- **Council NPC Dialogue:** Updates as global Barrier strengthens via Arcana donations

- **Legendary Status Progression:** Earned through major achievements, affects tax reduction chances

## 7.6. Enchantment System Architecture (v2.3.1)

### 🎯 **What This Section Does** (2)

**For Non-Coders:** This section explains how the enchantment (power-up) system works in the game. There are two types of enchantments: temporary ones that you buy during a journey with Arcana (and lose when you return home), and permanent ones that you buy with Soul Power and keep forever. The permanent ones make every journey start stronger - for example, if you have +5 permanent Firepower, every journey starts at Firepower level 5 instead of 0. This means you don't have to repeat the same early-game progression over and over.

**Technical Summary:** Complete architecture for dual-layer enchantment system supporting both temporary journey-bound upgrades (reset on return) and permanent meta-progression upgrades (persist across journeys) with comprehensive data structures and lifecycle management.

### Dual-Layer Enchant System with Soul Forging

The enchantment system supports both temporary and permanent progression, with a unified **Soul Forging** system for extending level caps:

#### Temporary Enchants (Journey-Bound)

- **Reset on Return:** All temporary enchant levels reset to starting levels
- **Arcana Cost:** Geometric progression (×1.12) for each level
- **Purpose:** Provide immediate power for current journey
- **Usage Location:** Can be purchased anywhere during journey
- **Currency:** Arcana (earned during journeys)

#### Permanent Starting Levels (Meta Progression)

- **Soul Power Purchase:** Permanent upgrades using Soul Power currency
- **Starting Level Boost:** Each journey begins at purchased starting level
- **Example:** +5 permanent Firepower means every journey starts at Firepower level 5
- **Purpose:** Provide long-term progression and reduce early-game repetition
- **Usage Location:** Can ONLY be purchased in Draconia (main town/base)
- **Currency:** Soul Power (earned from kills and research)
- **Restriction:** Cannot be spent during journeys - only in Draconia

#### Soul Forging System (Cap Extension)

**Soul Forging** is the process of forging your soul with dragon essence to extend your power's reach. Available in two forms:

##### Temporary Soul Forging (Arcana)
- **When:** During journey
- **Where:** Can be purchased anywhere during journey
- **Currency:** Arcana
- **Cost:** 15-25× last level cost
- **Benefit:** +60 levels to cap for current journey
- **Reset:** Lost when returning to Draconia

##### Permanent Soul Forging (Soul Power)
- **When:** At Draconia (between journeys)
- **Where:** Can ONLY be purchased in Draconia (main town/base)
- **Currency:** Soul Power
- **Cost:** High Soul Power cost
- **Benefit:** +60 levels to cap for all future journeys
- **Persistence:** Never lost, affects every journey
- **Restriction:** Cannot be spent during journeys - only in Draconia

### Implementation Architecture

```typescript

// What this does: Defines the complete data structure for the dual-layer enchantment
system
// Why this exists: Allows tracking both temporary journey upgrades and permanent
meta-progression
upgrades
// How it integrates: Used by enchant managers, UI systems, and save/load functionality
// Usage context: Created and maintained throughout the game lifecycle for all enchantment
operations
interface EnchantSystem {
  // Temporary journey levels - these reset to permanent levels when returning to Draconia
  // What this does: Tracks current journey-specific enchantment levels
// Why this exists: Allows players to temporarily boost power during journeys with Arcana
  // How it integrates: Modified during journey when spending Arcana, reset on return
  temporary: {
    firepower: number;  // Current Firepower level (0 to current cap)
    scales: number;     // Current Scales level (0 to current cap)
  };

// Permanent starting levels - these persist across all journeys and are purchased with
Soul
Power
  // What this does: Tracks permanent enchantment upgrades that affect starting levels
  // Why this exists: Provides long-term progression and reduces early-game repetition
// How it integrates: Modified when spending Soul Power, used to initialize temporary
levels
  permanent: {
firepower: number; // Permanent Firepower starting level (purchased with Soul Power)
scales: number; // Permanent Scales starting level (purchased with Soul Power)
  };

  // Soul Forging system - extends level caps
  // What this does: Tracks soul forging extensions that increase level caps
  // Why this exists: Allows players to extend their power's reach beyond base caps
  // How it integrates: Used to calculate effective level caps for enchantments
  soulForging: {
    temporary: number;  // Arcana-based soul forging (current journey only)
    permanent: number;  // Soul Power-based soul forging (permanent)
  };

  // Calculated effective levels - these are what actually affect gameplay
  // What this does: Combines temporary and permanent levels for actual game mechanics
  // Why this exists: Provides single source of truth for enchantment power calculations
  // How it integrates: Used by combat system, UI display, and damage calculations
  effective: {
    firepower: number;  // Total Firepower = temporary.firepower + permanent.firepower
    scales: number;     // Total Scales = temporary.scales + permanent.scales
    cap: number;        // Effective cap = baseCap + (soulForging.temporary + soulForging.permanent) * 60
  };
}

```javascript

### Journey Lifecycle

1. **Journey Start:** Enchants initialize to permanent starting levels, soul forging resets to permanent levels

2. **During Journey:** Arcana can be spent to increase temporary levels and perform temporary soul forging

3. **Journey End:** Temporary levels and temporary soul forging reset, permanent levels and permanent soul forging persist

4. **Meta Progression:** Soul Power can be spent to increase permanent starting levels and perform permanent soul forging

## 8. Town, Lair & City Public Works

### Lair v0

- Rooms: Nest, Workshop, Trophy Hall

- **Comfort → Rested cap & regen** only (≤5% DPS pre-Rift)

### City Public Works

- Pipeline: Gather → Transport → Refine → Build → Commission

- Bastion Tier raises **population/footfall** & hiring quality

- **Arcana Investments:** Donate Arcana to expand housing, civic spires, and public works for permanent global buffs

- **Barrier Integration:** Arcana donations strengthen Draconia's Great Shield, with occasional region events

### Safeguards

- Income caps at early tiers; slow unlocks ensure meta doesn't eclipse core combat before credits

- City bonuses ≤10% pre-Rift

---

## 9. Automation: Roads, Convoys & Stewards

### Systems

- Single route & Node; Guards; **Safety Index**

- Steward contracts (weaker dragons): scroll vs mats focus

- Incidents cause **downtime only** (no loot loss)

### Future Automation

- Assign junior dragons to Lands for passive searches (RNG mitigated with pity)

---

## 10. Endgame: Rift Siege & NG+

### Components

- Forward outposts (timed mini-projects)

- Siege gauntlet (phases; ability checks)

- NG+ mutators (resource attrition; elemental embargo weeks)

### Design Philosophy

- Clear achievable without deep town but juiced by good civic play

---

## 11. Frontend Architecture

### Stack

- **Platforms:** Desktop browsers (Chromium/Firefox/Edge), mobile browsers; installable PWA

- **Render:** **PixiJS** (WebGL) for combat scene; Svelte UI overlays

- **Sim:** **Web Workers** handle spawning, projectiles, DPS/HP math, and offline ticks

- **Persist:** **Dexie** (IndexedDB) with versioned schema, migrations, and integrity validation

- **PWA:** Workbox precache + update toast ("New version available → Reload")

### UI Layout Architecture

Based on precise pixel analysis of the steppe_background.png (2160x1080), the game interface is divided into three distinct UI areas:

```typescript

// UI Layout Measurements (1080px height reference)
export interface UILayoutMeasurements {
  // Space Area (Top) - Currency Display
  space: {
    top: 0;                    // 0px (0%)
    bottom: 100;              // 100px (9.26%)
    height: 100;              // 100px (9.26%)
    purpose: 'currency_display';
    elements: ['arcana_counter', 'soul_power_counter', 'status_indicators'];
  };

  // Sky Blue Band (Middle) - Action/Journey Area
  actionArea: {
    top: 100;                 // 100px (9.26%)
    bottom: 525;              // 525px (48.61%)
    height: 425;              // 425px (39.35%)
    purpose: 'gameplay_action';
    elements: ['dragon_protagonist', 'enemies', 'projectiles', 'combat_effects'];
  };

  // Ground Area (Bottom) - Player UI
  playerUI: {
    top: 525;                 // 525px (48.61%)
    bottom: 1080;             // 1080px (100%)
    height: 555;              // 555px (51.39%)
    purpose: 'upgrades_menus_player_ui';
    elements: ['upgrade_buttons', 'menu_navigation', 'player_stats', 'settings'];
  };
}

// Precise percentage values for responsive scaling
export const UI_LAYOUT_PERCENTAGES = {
  space: {
    top: 0.0000,              // 0% from top
    bottom: 0.0926,           // 9.26% from top
    height: 0.0926,           // 9.26% of screen height
  },
  actionArea: {
    top: 0.0926,              // 9.26% from top
    bottom: 0.4861,           // 48.61% from top
    height: 0.3935,           // 39.35% of screen height
  },
  playerUI: {
    top: 0.4861,              // 48.61% from top
    bottom: 1.0000,           // 100% from top
    height: 0.5139,           // 51.39% of screen height
  },
} as const;
```

#### UI Area Purposes

**Space Area (0px - 100px / 0% - 9.26%)**
- **Purpose**: Currency and status display
- **Elements**: Arcana counter, Soul Power counter, health indicators
- **Visual**: Dark blue space with stars
- **Interaction**: Minimal, primarily informational

**Action Area (100px - 525px / 9.26% - 48.61%)**
- **Purpose**: Core gameplay and journey
- **Elements**: Dragon protagonist, enemies, projectiles, combat effects
- **Visual**: Light blue sky band
- **Interaction**: Primary game interaction zone

**Player UI Area (525px - 1080px / 48.61% - 100%)**
- **Purpose**: Upgrades, menus, and player interface
- **Elements**: Upgrade buttons, menu navigation, player stats, settings
- **Visual**: Ground/horizon area
- **Interaction**: Secondary UI interactions

### Stores & Flags

```typescript

export interface AppFlags {
  hud: boolean;
  tlmVerbose: boolean;
}

export const appFlags = readable<AppFlags>({
  hud: false,
  tlmVerbose: false
});

```bash

### Routing

- `/` Splash, `/journey`, `/return`, `/town`, `/stats`

---

## 12. Simulation: Workers & Protocol

### Lifecycle

- FG: fixed **16.67ms**; BG: hidden → **2 Hz** sim; resume FG gracefully

### Protocol v1

```typescript

// UI->Sim
type UIToSim =
  | { t: 'boot'; seed: number }
  | { t: 'start' }
  | { t: 'stop' }
  | { t: 'ability'; id: number }
  | { t: 'offline'; elapsedMs: number };

// Sim->UI
type SimToUI =
  | { t: 'ready' }
| { t: 'tick'; now: number; stats: { fps: number; enemies: number; proj: number; dps:
number
}
}
  | { t: 'log'; lvl: 'info' | 'warn' | 'error'; msg: string }
  | { t: 'fatal'; reason: string };

```bash

### Determinism

- RNG: xoroshiro/PCG streams per system (spawns/crits)

- Fixed timestep (16.67ms), offline stub, auto-recover

---

## 13. Rendering & Performance Budgets

### Pixi Mount

- Resize, DPR, ticker; pause rendering when hidden (sim continues in BG)

### Pooling & Culling

- Enemies/projectiles pooled; offscreen culled; pooled damage numbers/text

### Budgets

- 60 fps desktop; ≥40 fps mid-phones; ≤200/400 enemies; ≤600 proj/s

### Performance Targets

- **Frame time:** ~16.6ms desktop; target ≥25ms ceiling mid-phones

- **Entities:** 200 active (burst 400); projectiles ≤600/s

- **Bundles:** base app ≤ 200 KB gz; logger layer ≤ **8 KB gz**; defer heavy tools

- **Workers:** no layout work; isolate hot loops; avoid GC via pooling

---

## 14. Persistence: Dexie Save Schema

### Overview

IndexedDB via Dexie; Zod codecs; **double-buffer** atomic writes; backups; export/import

### Schema (V1)

```typescript

export interface SaveV1 {
  version: 1;
  profiles: Profile[];
  settings: { a11yReducedMotion: boolean };
}

export interface Profile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: number;
  lastActive: number;
  progress: { land: number; ward: number; distanceM: number };
  currencies: {
    arcana: number;
    gold: number;
    soulPower: number;
    astralSeals: number;
  };
  enchants: {
    firepower: number;
    scales: number;
    tier: number;
  };
  // v2.3.1 Permanent Enchant Starting Levels
  enchantStartingLevels: {
    firepower: number;  // Permanent starting level (purchased with Soul Power)
    scales: number;     // Permanent starting level (purchased with Soul Power)
    tier: number;       // Permanent starting tier (purchased with Soul Power)
  };
  stats: { playtimeS: number; deaths: number; totalDistanceM: number };
  leaderboard: { highestWard: number; fastestBossS: number };
  // v2.3.1 Arcana Expansion
  arcanaExpansion: {
    shieldBankDeposited: number;
    cityDonations: number;
    barrierPower: number;
    transmutationAttempts: number;
    transmutationSuccesses: number;
    legendaryStatus: number; // affects Shield Tax reduction chance
  };
}

```javascript

### Logger Design

```typescript

export type LogLevel = 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
export type LogEvent = {
  t: number; // epoch ms
  lvl: LogLevel;
  src: 'ui' | 'worker' | 'render' | 'net';
  msg: string;
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;
  profileId?: string; // no PII beyond dragon name, unless user opts in
};

```text

### Caps & Persistence

- **Caps:** **2 MB or 10k entries**, whichever reached first; oldest-first eviction

- **Persistence:** Dexie store `logs` with rolling buffer; toggleable in dev/prod; export from UI

---

## 15. Telemetry, Stats & Analytics

### Package

`@draconia/telemetry`: Aggregator Worker; Dexie queues (cap 1–2 MB or 5k events); lifetime
&
daily
snapshots

### Event Schema

```typescript

export type Ev = {
  ts: number;
  v: 1;
  sid: string;
  cid: string;
  build: string;
  n: string;
  p?: Record<string, number | string | boolean>;
};

```javascript

### Stats Page

- Overview, Progression, Combat, Economy, Offline, Performance

- NDJSON Export; macro-events to Plausible/Fathom (opt-in)

### Privacy

- **Logging:** **Structured JSON** logs, persisted **ring buffer (cap 2 MB OR 10k entries)**, exportable JSON. No PII beyond dragon name unless user explicitly opts in

---

## 16. Firecraft, Safety & Scales Tech Trees

### Core Philosophy

**Discovery before Unlock:** Only **Ember Potency** and **Draconic Vitality** are visible at game start. **All other nodes** (Firecraft/Safety/Scales) are **hidden** by default and must be **discovered** in the Research Lab.

### Research States

`Unknown → Discovered (via Research) → Soul-Unlocked → Arcana-Leveled`

### Fire Tiers & Global Risk

Tiers are **global states** that modify the breath's nature and **increase hazard**
(self-risk)..
They don't level; they **toggle on** when you meet triggers.

| Tier | Feel | Hazard Mult | Key Trigger |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Regular | baseline | 1.00 | default |
| Blue | smokeless, piercing jets | 1.05 | Hydride≥6 + Oxygenator≥4 + Honeycomb≥1 |
| Green | solvent/caustic DoT | 1.10 | Resin≥6 + Honeycomb≥3 + Swirl≥3 |
| Purple | chain arcs + pulse staggers | 1.15 | Arc Organ≥6 + Pulse Reactor≥3 + Variable
Swirlers≥2
|
| Dark | terror ticks / overburn nuance | 1.20 | Arc Organ≥4 + Pulse Rate Tuning unlocked
+
Oxy-Shunt
unlocked
|
| Black | ink/smoke fields + stacking DoT | 1.25 | Napalm Fractionator + Dust Cyclone +
Preheater≥4
|
| Holy | radiant vs..
corrupted; self-cleanse | 1.30 | Honeycomb≥5 + Pilot Comb≥4 + Oxy-Shunt unlocked |
| Azure | armor-piercing beam lance | 1.35 | (Blue) + Heater≥5 + Jet Discipline≥3 + Beam
pattern≥3
|
| Prismatic | cross-style combo windows | 1.40 | Any 3 style modes + Dual Split-Beams |
| Void | apex glass-cannon annihilation | 1.50 | Combined depth of Black+Dark+Azure ≥ 24 |

### Currencies & Economy

- **Arcana (persistent):** earned per kill; **persists across journeys**; spent to level unlocked nodes during a journey; also used for city investments, transmutation, and Shield Bank deposits

- **Soul Power (meta):** permanent currency; spent to **unlock** discovered nodes and buy permanent starts-at-level bonuses

- **Synth Materials:** created in the **city** over **time** (and prior synth inputs). Provide ingredients for Research

- **Minerals (Gold → Royal Platinum):** upgrades that **speed up** and **discount** the Synth system globally; can be transmuted using Gold + Arcana

### Research Lab System

- **Lab Level (L1→L8+):** journey progression that controls what **depth** of topics appear, and **capacity** (parallel slots & queue)

- **Research Title:** 1:1 with a hidden node; completing the job **reveals** the node in the tree

- **Costs:** Soul + Synth + time

---

## 17. Balancing: Math, Curves & Tables

### Offline Models

- **Model A — Linear→Decay:** `gain = rate * min(t, 8h) + rate * decay(t-8h)` with `decay(x)=x * e^(-k x)`; `k` tuned to hit caps

- **Model B — Logistic Cap:** `gain = cap / (1 + e^(-a(t-b)))` minus offset to start near-linear; intuitive caps, easy tuning

- **Model C — Piecewise Power:** full rate to 8h; `rate * (Δt)^α` for remainder (`0<α<1`)

### Costs & Ramps

- **Enchant level cost:** `cost(l) = base * 1.12^l` (tune base per Tier)

- **Tier‑Up:** single large purchase; suggest 15–25× last level cost

- **Enemy HP/DMG:** ward bump + micro-ramp

### Anti-cheese Measures

- Minimum session runtime before next rested grant

- Single outstanding rested

- Diminishing rested if claimed repeatedly within 24h

---

## 18. Region R01: Horizon Steppe

### Overview (2)

**Tagline:** *Where sky kisses grass and home feels near.*

**Blurb:** The innermost prairie of the Dragonlands—wide, wind-brushed fields within sight of Draconia's spires. Thermals rise warm and steady, wildflowers stripe the downs, and old waystones mark the dragon flight-paths radiating from the capital.

### Subzones & Landmarks

- **Sunwake Downs** — golden grasses; tutorial stretch; gentle thermals

- **Waystone Mile** — line of ancient stone markers; distance gates & save icons

- **Skylark Flats** — constant updrafts; air skirmishes feel lively but forgiving

- **Longgrass Reach** — rolling swales; parallax grass "wobble" subtly tests accuracy

- **Bluewind Shelf** — low bluff; persistent crosswind challenges projectile travel

- **Old Hoard Road** — caravan trail from Draconia; lore chips and small chests

- **First Horizon** — panoramic ridge; boss approach with skyline staging

### Plains Faction: Wind-Taken Nomads

**Vibe:** Plains megafauna and sail-kites ridden by airy revenants. They sculpt crosswinds with banners and kites, scatter dust veils, and use skyhooks/bolas to tug even dragons off-line.

### Combat Signature

- **Crosswind Control:** Temporary **wind walls** deflect some projectiles

- **Tethers & Pulls:** Skyhooks/bolas apply short **drag/slow**, nudging aim timing

- **Lane Objects:** Planted **banners**, **kites**, and **gust totems** are destructibles that buff allies until burned or overcharged

### Boss: Khagan of the Sirocco

A colossal ridge-beast draped in a canopy of war-kites and pennants.

**Phases & Mechanics:**

1. **Bannerline:** Plants three **Sirocco Standards** across the lane → overlapping crosswinds

1. **Stampede Call:** Summons Dust-Mane waves; boss gains 25% damage reduction until ≥2 standards are destroyed

1. **Bola Tempest:** Rotating bolas create moving "no-fly" arcs

---

## 19. Premium Currency: Astral Seals

### Overview (3)

**Astral Seals** are the premium currency of Draconia Chronicles, rooted in **Draconia's cosmic lore** rather than simple wealth or ancestry.

### Lore & Mythology

- **Origin Flame:** The **First Flame** fractured, scattering into **Origin Shards**, drifting across the cosmos

- **Sealing of the Skies:** Gods bound fragments of the cosmos into radiant tokens called **Astral Seals**

- **The Comet Showers:** When comets passed Draconia, they shed **Starlit Shards** — radiant fragments that rained down as meteors

- **Modern Role:** Astral Seals remain both mystical relics and functional currency, petitioning the gods themselves

### Visual Identity

- **Shape:** Irregular crystalline medallions, faceted and rune-etched

- **Core Glow:** Pulsing starlight at the center, glowing brighter than the edges

- **Surface:** Arcane runes etched into the surface, shifting slowly as if alive

- **Effect:** Appears to hover, shimmering faintly with cosmic light

### Usage

- Rune Gachapon (randomized rune draws)

- Unlocking additional Rune Slots

- Unlocking additional Lab Slots

- Unlocking Lab Queues

- (Future) Cosmetic purchases

### Economy Philosophy

- **Not Pay-to-Win:** Runes and lab upgrades accelerate progress but are not required to finish the game

- **Scarcity:** Astral Seals must feel rare — earned slowly in-game, sparingly sold in premium bundles

- **Prestige:** Seals serve as a mark of dedication or investment, not of honor or ancestry

---

## 20. Testing, QA & CI/CD

### Testing Matrix

- **Unit:** math, RNG, ability lifecycle, offline calc

- **Integration:** sim→drops→Arcana→purchase→Return; Dexie save/load; stats counters

- **E2E:** Splash→Name→Journey→Return→Upgrade; `/stats` export; error boundary

### CI Gates

- Typecheck, lint, unit/integration, Playwright smoke, size budgets, Lighthouse (warn/gate)

### Git Hooks

- Husky v9+, lint-staged, commitlint (conventional)

### Quality Gates

- **Unit:** Vitest for math/curves/config; property tests for offline models

- **Integration:** store interactions, worker protocol, Dexie migrations

- **E2E:** Playwright — UI flows, a11y focus order, fake time jumps for offline simulation

- **A11y gates:** Lighthouse **≥95**; axe-core in CI for violations; reduced-motion snapshots

---

## 21. Accessibility & Mobile UX

### MVP A11y

- Visible focus rings, logical tab order, ARIA labels/roles, reduced-motion mode, **44×44 targets**

- Lighthouse a11y **≥95** gate when enabled

### Mobile Patterns

- Bottom sheets, FAB, big touch targets, gesture scope (scroll/zoom only)

### Controls & UX

- **Desktop:** keyboard hotkeys (phase into rebinding in 2.0), mouse clicks for abilities

- **Mobile:** bottom-sheet dialogs, **FAB** bottom-right for primary action, 44×44 hit targets, pinch-zoom/scroll only for gestures

- **Logs:** **player-facing narration** and **debug logs** (dual stream); narration is a live region for a11y

### Future A11y (2.0)

- Color-blind palettes, key rebinding, gamepad/controller, screen-shake intensity slider, full captions and SFX mixing

---

## 23. Security, Privacy & Legal

### Privacy (2)

- No PII beyond dragon name in save; telemetry local + export; opt-out for external analytics

### Security

- Content validation, Zod codecs, save import checksums, sandboxed mod API

### Legal

- **Mod policy** (Zomboid-like): rights to integrate; attribution; code of conduct

### Risks & Mitigations

- **Meta overshadowing combat** → Gate meta post-chapter; hard budgets on income until Ch.1 clear

- **Offline cheese** → cooldown for rested; caps; session requirement; serverless integrity (seeded RNG)

- **Mobile perf** → early asset budgets; LOD sprites; optional 30 fps fallback

- **Save corruption** → Zod validation; transactional writes; cloudless export/import
