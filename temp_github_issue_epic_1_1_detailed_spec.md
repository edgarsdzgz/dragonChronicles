# Epic 1.1: Core Game Loop Foundation - Detailed Technical Specifications

**Status:** üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - P1-S1 Completed, Remaining Stories Pending
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies:** Phase 0 Complete
**Total Stories:** 7 (including completed P1-S1)

## üéØ **Epic 1.1 Overview - What This Epic Does**

**For Non-Coders:** Epic 1.1 creates the fundamental "engine" that powers the core game loop. Think of it as building the foundation of a house - everything else in the game will be built on top of this. This epic handles:

1. **Starting and Stopping Journeys** - How players begin their dragon adventures

1. **Distance Travel** - How far the dragon travels at constant speed with enemies getting stronger

1. **Ward Progression** - How players advance through different areas (Ward 1, Ward 2, etc.)

1. **Return System** - How players come back to Draconia with their rewards

1. **Offline Progress** - How the game continues even when players aren't actively playing

1. **Divine Favor System** - How players can earn temporary divine blessings for active play

**Technical Summary:** Epic 1.1 establishes the core game loop infrastructure including journey state management, constant-speed distance progression with enemy stat micro-ramps, ward/land advancement systems, return-to-Draconia flow with arcana donation and enchantment reset, offline progression simulation with decay mechanics, and divine favor system with cooldowns.

## üèóÔ∏è **What We'll Have Completed After Epic 1.1**

## 1.1.1: Journey State Management

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Dependencies:** 1.1.0 Complete
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### üìñ **What This Story Does** (2)

**For Non-Coders:** This story creates the system that manages when players start, pause, resume, and end their dragon journeys. Think of it like the "play button" system in a music player - it handles all the different states (playing, paused, stopped) and makes sure the game knows exactly what the player is doing at any moment. This includes:

- **Starting a Journey:** When a player clicks "Begin Journey" and selects their land/ward

- **Pausing:** When a player temporarily stops (like closing the app or switching tabs)

- **Resuming:** When a player comes back and wants to continue where they left off

- **Stopping:** When a player decides to return to Draconia with their rewards

- **Error Handling:** When something goes wrong and the game needs to recover gracefully

**Technical Summary:** Implements journey state machine with 7 states (IDLE, STARTING, ACTIVE, PAUSED, STOPPING, STOPPED, ERROR), state transition logic, message handling for UI‚ÜíSim communication, context management for journey data, and comprehensive validation for all state changes.

### üèóÔ∏è **What We'll Have After 1.1.1**

**For Non-Coders:** After completing this story, players will be able to:

- Start their dragon journey by selecting a land and ward

- Pause their journey (like closing the app) and resume later without losing progress

- Stop their journey and return to Draconia with their earned rewards

- Have the game automatically handle errors and recovery situations

**Technical Deliverables:** Complete journey state management system with state machine, message contracts, validation, context tracking, and telemetry for all state changes.

### üîß **Technical Specifications** (2)

#### Core State Machine

**What This Does:** Defines the 7 different "modes" the journey can be in at any time.

```typescript

// What this does: Defines all possible states a journey can be in
// Why this exists: Ensures the game knows exactly what the player is doing at all times
// How it integrates: Used by the journey manager to control game flow and UI display
// Usage context: Referenced throughout the journey lifecycle to determine available
actions
enum JourneyState {
IDLE = 'idle', // Player is in Draconia, not on a journey - can start new journey
  STARTING = 'starting',   // Journey is being initialized - loading assets and setting up
ACTIVE = 'active', // Player is actively traveling and progressing through the world
PAUSED = 'paused', // Journey is temporarily stopped (app closed, tab hidden, etc.)
STOPPING = 'stopping', // Journey is ending - processing rewards and returning to Draconia
  STOPPED = 'stopped',     // Journey complete - player is back in Draconia with rewards
  ERROR = 'error'          // Something critical went wrong - needs recovery or reset
}

// What this does: Stores all the information needed to track a journey session
// Why this exists: Provides complete context for the current journey state and history
// How it integrates: Passed between journey manager, UI, and save system
// Usage context: Created when journey starts, updated throughout, saved on pause/stop
interface JourneyContext {
  state: JourneyState;           // Current journey state - determines what player can do
startTime: number; // When journey began (timestamp) - used for duration calculations
pauseTime?: number; // When journey was paused (if paused) - for resume calculations
totalPausedDuration: number; // Total time spent paused - subtracted from journey duration
sessionId: string; // Unique identifier for this journey - used for telemetry and saves
landId: LandId; // Which land player is currently in (1, 2, 3...) - affects enemy types
wardId: WardId; // Which ward within that land (1, 2, 3...) - affects difficulty
}

```bash

#### State Transitions

**What This Does:** Defines the rules for how the journey moves between different states. Like a flowchart that shows what can happen next.

- **IDLE ‚Üí STARTING:** When user clicks "Begin Journey" button

- **STARTING ‚Üí ACTIVE:** After the game successfully loads the journey

- **ACTIVE ‚Üí PAUSED:** When user closes app or switches to another app

- **PAUSED ‚Üí ACTIVE:** When user reopens app and wants to continue

- **ACTIVE ‚Üí STOPPING:** When user clicks "Return to Draconia" or dragon dies

- **STOPPING ‚Üí STOPPED:** After processing rewards and returning to town

- **ANY ‚Üí ERROR:** When something critical goes wrong (network failure, etc.)

#### Message Handling

**What This Does:** Defines the "messages" that the user interface sends to the game simulation to control the journey. Like remote control commands.

```typescript

// What this does: Defines the communication protocol between UI and simulation
// Why this exists: Allows the user interface to control the game simulation safely
// How it integrates: Used by the message router to process UI commands
// Usage context: Created by UI components and sent to simulation worker

// UI ‚Üí Sim Messages (User Interface sends these to the Game Simulation)
// What this does: Message sent when player wants to start a new journey
// Why this exists: Provides safe way for UI to initiate journey without direct access to
simulation
// How it integrates: Processed by journey manager to transition from IDLE to STARTING
state
// Usage context: Created when player clicks "Begin Journey" button
interface StartJourneyMessage {
  t: 'start_journey';     // Message type identifier - tells simulation what to do
landId: LandId; // Which land to start in (1, 2, 3...) - determines enemy types and
difficulty
wardId: WardId; // Which ward within that land (1, 2, 3...) - starting difficulty level
  sessionId: string;      // Unique session ID for tracking - used for telemetry and saves
}

// What this does: Message sent when journey needs to be paused
// Why this exists: Handles app suspension, tab switching, or user-requested pauses
// How it integrates: Transitions journey from ACTIVE to PAUSED state
// Usage context: Triggered by browser events or user actions
interface PauseJourneyMessage {
  t: 'pause_journey';      // Message type identifier - tells simulation to pause
reason: 'user*request' | 'tab*hidden' | 'system_sleep'; // Why it was paused - affects
resume
behavior
}

// What this does: Message sent when journey should be resumed after being paused
// Why this exists: Allows seamless continuation of journey after pause
// How it integrates: Transitions journey from PAUSED to ACTIVE state with time correction
// Usage context: Created when player returns to app or clicks resume button
interface ResumeJourneyMessage {
  t: 'resume_journey';     // Message type identifier - tells simulation to resume
elapsedMs: number; // How much time passed while paused - used for offline progression
calculation
}

// What this does: Message sent when journey should be ended and player returned to
Draconia
// Why this exists: Handles all journey ending scenarios (manual return, death, boss
defeat,
errors)
// How it integrates: Transitions journey from ACTIVE to STOPPING state
// Usage context: Created by various game events or user actions
interface StopJourneyMessage {
  t: 'stop_journey';       // Message type identifier - tells simulation to end journey
reason: 'user*return' | 'boss*defeated' | 'dragon_death' | 'error'; // Why it stopped -
affects
reward
processing
}

// Sim ‚Üí UI Messages (Game Simulation sends these back to User Interface)
interface JourneyStateMessage {
  t: 'journey_state';      // Message type: "here's the current journey status"
  state: JourneyState;     // Current state (active, paused, etc.)
  duration: number;        // How long the journey has been running
  distance: number;        // How far the dragon has traveled
}

describe('Journey State Machine', () => {
  test('should transition IDLE ‚Üí STARTING ‚Üí ACTIVE', () => {
    // Test: Start with idle state, send start message, then initialize
    const sm = new JourneyStateMachine();
    expect(sm.getState()).toBe(JourneyState.IDLE);  // Should start idle

    sm.handleMessage({ t: 'start_journey', landId: 1, wardId: 1, sessionId: 'test' });
    expect(sm.getState()).toBe(JourneyState.STARTING);  // Should move to starting

    sm.initialize();
    expect(sm.getState()).toBe(JourneyState.ACTIVE);  // Should become active
  });

  test('should handle pause/resume cycle', () => {
    // Test: Verify pause timing and duration tracking works correctly
  });

  test('should validate message inputs', () => {
    // Test: Make sure invalid inputs (bad landId, wardId, sessionId) are rejected
  });
});

```javascript

### üîó **Integration Tests**

**What These Tests Do:** These tests verify that the journey state system works correctly when combined with other parts of the game.

- **Journey state persistence across worker restarts** - Make sure journey state survives app crashes/restarts

## 1.1.2: Distance Progression System

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Dependencies:** 1.1.1 Complete
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

### üìñ **What This Story Does** (3)

**For Non-Coders:** This story creates the system that tracks how far the dragon travels at a **constant speed**. The dragon doesn't get faster over time - instead, the enemies get stronger as the dragon travels further. Think of it like a progress meter that tracks distance and enemy difficulty. The key features include:

- **Distance Tracking:** How far the dragon has traveled (in meters)

- **Constant Movement:** Dragon moves at steady speed throughout the journey

- **Enemy Scaling:** Enemies get stronger every 5-10 meters (micro-ramps in enemy stats)

- **Progress Visualization:** The UI shows players their current distance and enemy difficulty

- **Speed Boosts:** Later unlocked through enchants and tech tree abilities (not automatic)

**Technical Summary:** Implements constant-speed distance progression with enemy stat scaling at micro-ramp intervals, distance state management, and integration with journey state machine for progression tracking.

### üèóÔ∏è **What We'll Have After 1.1.2**

**For Non-Coders:** After completing this story, players will see:

- Their dragon moving forward at a steady, constant speed

- Distance counter showing how far they've traveled

- Enemy difficulty scaling as they progress further

- Progress visualization showing current distance and enemy strength

**Technical Deliverables:** Complete distance progression system with constant-speed movement, enemy stat scaling at micro-ramp intervals, state management, and telemetry for progression tracking.

### üîß **Technical Specifications** (3)

#### Distance Calculation

**What This Does:** Defines the configuration settings that control constant dragon movement speed and enemy stat scaling intervals.

```typescript

interface DistanceConfig {
  baseSpeedMps: number;        // Base dragon speed (15 m/s, upgradeable)
  microRampInterval: number;   // Base enemy scaling interval (5m, upgradeable)
  enemyStatMultiplier: number; // Base enemy scaling rate (1.05x, upgradeable)
  maxEnemyDifficulty: number;  // Base difficulty cap (10x, upgradeable)
}

// What this does: Tracks distance progression upgrades purchased with Soul Power
// Why this exists: Allows players to improve movement speed and adjust enemy scaling
through
meta-progression
// How it integrates: Modifies DistanceConfig values when calculating progression and
enemy
difficulty
interface DistanceUpgrades {
  speedBonus: number;              // Additional speed in m/s (e.g., +5 m/s from upgrades)
rampIntervalReduction: number; // Reduction to micro-ramp interval (0.0 = no reduction,
0.5
=
50%
reduction)
enemyScalingReduction: number; // Reduction to enemy scaling rate (0.0 = no reduction, 0.1
=
10%
reduction)
  difficultyCapBonus: number;      // Additional difficulty cap (e.g., +5x from upgrades)
}

interface DistanceState {
  currentDistance: number;     // How far the dragon has traveled (e.g., 1,250 meters)
enemyDifficultyLevel: number; // Current enemy difficulty multiplier (e.g., 2.5x base
stats)
  lastUpdateTime: number;      // When we last updated the distance (timestamp)
  totalDistance: number;       // Total distance in this journey (for tracking)
microRampCount: number; // How many enemy difficulty increases have occurred (e.g., 250
boosts)
}

```bash

#### Enemy Difficulty Scaling Formula

**What This Does:** This function calculates how much stronger enemies should be based on how far the dragon has traveled.

```typescript

// What this does: Calculates effective distance configuration with upgrades applied
// Why this exists: Allows players to improve movement speed and adjust enemy scaling
through
Soul
Power
purchases
// How it integrates: Used by all distance calculation methods to apply upgrade bonuses
function getEffectiveDistanceConfig(config: DistanceConfig, upgrades: DistanceUpgrades):
DistanceConfig
{
  return {
    baseSpeedMps: config.baseSpeedMps + upgrades.speedBonus,
    microRampInterval: config.microRampInterval * (1 - upgrades.rampIntervalReduction),
enemyStatMultiplier: config.enemyStatMultiplier * (1 - upgrades.enemyScalingReduction),
    maxEnemyDifficulty: config.maxEnemyDifficulty + upgrades.difficultyCapBonus
  };
}

function calculateEnemyDifficulty(distance: number, config: DistanceConfig, upgrades:
DistanceUpgrades):
number
{
  const effectiveConfig = getEffectiveDistanceConfig(config, upgrades);
const rampCount = Math.floor(distance / effectiveConfig.microRampInterval); // How many
difficulty
increases
const difficulty = Math.pow(effectiveConfig.enemyStatMultiplier, rampCount); // Calculate
total
difficulty
return Math.min(difficulty, effectiveConfig.maxEnemyDifficulty); // Cap at maximum
difficulty
}

```text

**Example:** If dragon travels 50 meters with 5m intervals and 1.05x enemy scaling:

- Ramp count = 50 √∑ 5 = 10 increases

- Difficulty = 1.05^10 = 1.63x enemy stats (63% stronger enemies)

function updateDistance(state: DistanceState, dtMs: number, config: DistanceConfig,
upgrades:
DistanceUpgrades):
DistanceState
{
  const effectiveConfig = getEffectiveDistanceConfig(config, upgrades);
const currentSpeed = effectiveConfig.baseSpeedMps; // Dragon speed with upgrades applied
const distanceDelta = (currentSpeed * dtMs) / 1000; // How far to move this frame
  const newDistance = state.currentDistance + distanceDelta;        // New total distance

  return {
    ...state,
currentDistance: newDistance, // Update distance traveled
enemyDifficultyLevel: calculateEnemyDifficulty(newDistance, config, upgrades), // Update
enemy
difficulty
totalDistance: state.totalDistance + distanceDelta, // Update total distance
microRampCount: Math.floor(newDistance / effectiveConfig.microRampInterval) // Update
difficulty
level
count
  };
}

```text

**What This Does:** Updates the dragon's distance at constant speed and calculates current enemy difficulty level.

#### Micro-Ramp System

**What This Does:** Manages the individual enemy difficulty scaling points as the dragon travels further.

```typescript

interface DifficultyRamp {
distance: number; // At what distance this difficulty increase activates (e.g., 5m, 10m,
15m)
difficultyMultiplier: number; // How much stronger enemies become (e.g., 1.05x, 1.10x,
1.15x)
  isActive: boolean;          // Whether the dragon has reached this difficulty level yet
}

class DifficultyRampManager {
  private ramps: DifficultyRamp[] = [];  // List of all difficulty scaling points

  constructor(private config: DistanceConfig) {
    this.generateRamps();  // Create all the difficulty scaling points upfront
  }

  private generateRamps(): void {
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { // Generate first 1000 difficulty scaling points
const distance = i * this.config.microRampInterval; // Distance for this scaling (5m, 10m,
etc.)
const difficulty = Math.pow(this.config.enemyStatMultiplier, i); // Enemy difficulty
multiplier
      this.ramps.push({
distance, // Where this scaling happens
difficultyMultiplier: Math.min(difficulty, this.config.maxEnemyDifficulty), // Cap at max
difficulty
        isActive: false  // Start as inactive (dragon hasn't reached it yet)
      });
    }
  }

  updateActiveRamps(currentDistance: number): void {
    this.ramps.forEach(ramp => {
ramp.isActive = currentDistance >= ramp.distance; // Mark as active if dragon has reached
this
distance
    });
  }

```javascript

**What This Does:** Checks which enemy difficulty scaling points have been reached based on how far the dragon has traveled and marks them as active.

## 1.1.3: Ward/Land State Machine

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Dependencies:** 1.1.2 Complete
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### üéØ **What This Story Does**

**For Non-Coders:** This story creates the system that manages how players progress through different areas (wards) within each land. Think of it like level progression in a game - players start in Ward 1, then advance to Ward 2, Ward 3, etc. as they get stronger. Each ward has different enemies, difficulty, and rewards. The system also handles what happens when players reach the end of a ward and need to advance to the next one. Key features include:

- **Ward Progression:** How players advance from Ward 1 ‚Üí Ward 2 ‚Üí Ward 3 ‚Üí Ward 4 ‚Üí Ward 5

- **Land Management:** How players unlock new lands (Land 1, Land 2, Land 3, etc.)

- **Difficulty Scaling:** Each ward gets progressively harder with stronger enemies

- **Transition Logic:** What happens when players complete a ward and move to the next

- **Configuration System:** How the game knows what enemies and rewards each ward should have

**Technical Summary:** Implement ward/land state machine with progression logic, configuration management for ward parameters, transition handling between wards, and integration with journey state machine for area advancement.

### üèóÔ∏è **What We'll Have After 1.1.3**

**For Non-Coders:** After this story, players will be able to progress through different wards within each land, with each ward getting progressively more challenging. The game will automatically handle transitions between wards and track the player's current location and progress.

**Technical Summary:** Complete ward/land progression system with configuration management, state transitions, and integration with journey and distance systems.

### üîß **Technical Specifications** (4)

**What This Section Does:** This section defines the technical implementation details for the ward/land progression system, including data structures, state management, and configuration systems.

**Why This Exists:** Provides the foundation for managing player progression through different areas and ensures consistent difficulty scaling.

**How It Integrates:** Used by the ward state machine to determine when players can advance and what challenges they'll face.

```typescript

interface LandConfig {
  id: LandId;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  baseDifficultyMultiplier: number;  // Base difficulty multiplier (upgradeable)
  wards: WardConfig[];
}

interface WardConfig {

// Why this exists: Allows players to reduce ward lengths, adjust difficulty scaling, and
modify
land
progression
through
meta-progression
// How it integrates: Modifies LandConfig and WardConfig values when calculating
progression
requirements
and
difficulty
scaling
interface WardLandUpgrades {
  // Ward Length Reductions - Reduce distance needed to complete wards

reduction)

  // Difficulty Scaling Modifications - Adjust enemy scaling within wards
scalingFactorReduction: number; // Reduction to ward scaling factors (0.0 = no reduction,
0.3
=
30%
reduction)

+25%
rewards)

  // Boss Encounter Modifications - Adjust boss difficulty and rewards
bossDifficultyReduction: number; // Reduction to boss difficulty (0.0 = no reduction, 0.15
=
15%
reduction)
bossRewardBonus: number; // Bonus rewards from bosses (0.0 = no bonus, 0.5 = +50% rewards)
}

interface WardState {
  currentWard: WardId;

  constructor(
    private landConfigs: Map<LandId, LandConfig>,
    private upgrades: WardLandUpgrades
  ) {
    this.wardProgress = new Map();
  }

  // What this does: Calculates effective ward configuration with upgrades applied
// Why this exists: Allows players to reduce ward lengths and adjust difficulty through
Soul
Power
purchases

      baseLengthM: wardConfig.baseLengthM * (1 - this.upgrades.wardLengthReduction),
baseScalingFactor: wardConfig.baseScalingFactor * (1 -
this.upgrades.scalingFactorReduction)
    };
  }

  // What this does: Calculates effective land configuration with upgrades applied
// Why this exists: Allows players to reduce overall land difficulty through Soul Power
purchases
  // How it integrates: Used by all land difficulty calculations to apply upgrade bonuses
  private getEffectiveLandConfig(landConfig: LandConfig): LandConfig {
    return {
      ...landConfig,
baseDifficultyMultiplier: landConfig.baseDifficultyMultiplier * (1 -
this.upgrades.landDifficultyReduction)
    };
  }

  advanceToNextWard(reason: WardTransitionReason): boolean {
    const currentConfig = this.getCurrentWardConfig();
    if (!currentConfig) return false;

    const nextWardId = this.getNextWardId();
    if (!nextWardId) return false; // No more wards

    // Complete current ward
    this.completeWard(currentConfig, reason);

    // Start next ward
    this.startWard(nextWardId);

    return true;
  }

  updateProgress(distanceDelta: number): void {
    const currentConfig = this.getCurrentWardConfig();
    if (!currentConfig) return;

    const effectiveConfig = this.getEffectiveWardConfig(currentConfig);
    const wardState = this.wardProgress.get(this.currentWard)!;
    wardState.distanceInWard += distanceDelta;
wardState.progress = Math.min(wardState.distanceInWard / effectiveConfig.baseLengthM,
1.0);

    // Check for ward completion
    if (wardState.progress >= 1.0) {
      this.advanceToNextWard(WardTransitionReason.DISTANCE_REACHED);
    }
  }
}

## 1.1.4: Return to Draconia System

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Dependencies:** 1.1.3 Complete
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

### üéØ **What This Story Does** (2)

**For Non-Coders:** This story creates the system for when players return to Draconia from their journey. Instead of donating all their Arcana (like in the old system), players now keep their Arcana but pay a Shield Tax. This tax is 25% of their total Arcana and goes to help protect the city. The system also resets temporary enchantments while keeping permanent upgrades, and handles selling items for Gold.

**Technical Summary:** Implement return flow with Shield Tax system (25% of total Arcana), enchantment reset to permanent starting levels, item sales for Gold, and complete journey lifecycle management.

### üîß **Technical Specifications** (5)

**What This Section Does:** This section defines the technical implementation details for the return to Draconia system, including the Shield Tax calculation, enchantment reset logic, and item sales processing.

#### Return Flow State Machine

  DRAGON*DEATH = 'dragon*death',
  TIME*LIMIT = 'time*limit',
  ERROR*RECOVERY = 'error*recovery'
}

```bash

#### Shield Tax System (v2.3.1)

```typescript

interface ShieldTaxConfig {

## 1.1.5: Basic Offline Progression

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Dependencies:** 1.1.4 Complete
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 days

### üéØ **What This Story Does** (3)

**For Non-Coders:** This story creates the system that allows the game to continue progressing even when players are not actively playing. Think of it like a city simulation that keeps running in the background - when players come back after being away, they'll find that their dragon has made some progress automatically. The system includes:

- **Offline Simulation:** The game continues running even when the app is closed

- **Progression Decay:** The longer players are away, the less efficient the offline progress becomes

- **Time Limits:** Offline progress has a maximum duration (24 hours) to prevent infinite gains

- **Linear to Diminishing:** First 8 hours give full progress, then efficiency decreases over time

- **Return Calculation:** When players come back, the game calculates how much progress was made

**Technical Summary:** Implement offline progression simulation with linear decay model (8h full efficiency, then diminishing returns), maximum 24-hour offline limit, and comprehensive offline session management with telemetry tracking.

### üèóÔ∏è **What We'll Have After 1.1.5**

**For Non-Coders:** After this story, players can close the game and come back later to find that their dragon has made some progress automatically. This makes the game feel alive and rewards players for returning, while preventing excessive offline gains that would break the game balance.

**Technical Summary:** Complete offline progression system with decay mechanics, session management, and integration with journey state machine for seamless offline/online transitions.

### üîß **Technical Specifications** (6)

**What This Section Does:** This section defines the technical implementation details for the offline progression system, including data structures, simulation models, and background processing systems.

**For Non-Coders:** This section explains the technical blueprint for how the game continues to make progress even when players aren't actively playing, detailing the underlying code and calculations that make offline progression work.

**Technical Context:** The offline progression system uses mathematical models to simulate what would have happened if the player had been actively playing, with realistic decay mechanics to prevent exploitation.

#### Offline Simulation Model

**What This Does:** Defines the configuration settings that control how offline progression works, including time limits, efficiency decay, and progression rates.

**Why This Exists:** Provides a balanced system where players get meaningful progress when offline but can't exploit the system with excessive offline time, maintaining game balance and encouraging active play.

**How It Integrates:** These settings are used by the offline simulator to calculate how much progress a player should receive when they return, based on how long they were away.

**Implementation Details:** The model uses a two-phase system: full efficiency for the first 8 hours, then linear decay down to 10% minimum efficiency over the next 16 hours.

```typescript

interface OfflineConfig {
  maxOfflineHours: number;        // Maximum offline time (24 hours base, upgradeable)
  linearDecayStart: number;       // Hours before decay starts (8 hours base, upgradeable)
  decayRate: number;              // Decay rate per hour (0.1 = 10% base, reducible)
  minEfficiency: number;          // Minimum efficiency (0.1 = 10% base, upgradeable)
  baseProgressionRate: number;    // Base progression rate (1.0 = 100%, upgradeable)
}

// What this does: Tracks offline progression upgrades purchased with Soul Power
// Why this exists: Allows players to improve offline progression through meta-progression
// How it integrates: Modifies OfflineConfig values when calculating offline gains
interface OfflineUpgrades {
  maxHoursBonus: number;          // Additional hours added to maxOfflineHours
  decayStartBonus: number;        // Additional hours before decay starts
decayReduction: number; // Reduction to decayRate (0.0 = no reduction, 0.5 = 50%
reduction)
  minEfficiencyBonus: number;     // Bonus added to minEfficiency
  progressionBonus: number;       // Multiplier to baseProgressionRate
}

interface OfflineSession {
  startTime: number;              // Timestamp when offline started
  endTime: number;                // Timestamp when returning
  totalOfflineMs: number;         // Total offline time in milliseconds
  effectiveOfflineMs: number;     // Effective offline time after decay
  progressionGained: number;      // Total progression gained
  arcanaEarned: number;           // Arcana earned during offline
  itemsFound: ItemDrop[];         // Items found during offline
}

class OfflineSimulator {
  private config: OfflineConfig;
  private upgrades: OfflineUpgrades;

  constructor(config: OfflineConfig, upgrades: OfflineUpgrades) {

    currentState: GameState
  ): OfflineSession {
    const totalOfflineMs = endTime - startTime;
    const totalOfflineHours = totalOfflineMs / (1000 * 60 * 60);

    // Calculate effective offline time with decay
    const effectiveHours = this.calculateEffectiveTime(totalOfflineHours);
    const effectiveOfflineMs = effectiveHours * (1000 * 60 * 60);

    // Simulate progression
    const progressionGained = this.simulateProgression(effectiveOfflineMs, currentState);
    const arcanaEarned = this.simulateArcanaGains(effectiveOfflineMs, currentState);

    }

    const decayHours = totalHours - effectiveConfig.linearDecayStart;
    const decayFactor = Math.pow(1 - effectiveConfig.decayRate, decayHours);
    const minEfficiency = effectiveConfig.minEfficiency;

    // Linear period + decay period with upgrades applied
    const linearHours = effectiveConfig.linearDecayStart;

#### Offline Progression Upgrade System

**What This Does:** Provides a system for players to improve their offline progression capabilities through Soul Power purchases, allowing customization of offline time limits, decay rates, and efficiency bonuses.

**Why This Exists:** Creates long-term progression goals and allows players to optimize their offline experience based on their playstyle and schedule, while providing meaningful Soul Power sinks.

**How It Integrates:** Works with the Soul Power meta-progression system to allow permanent upgrades that modify offline progression parameters, creating player agency and customization.

**Implementation Details:** Uses a separate upgrade tracking system that modifies base configuration values, ensuring upgrades persist across sessions and provide consistent benefits.

```typescript

// Example upgrade scenarios:
// Base: 24h max, 8h linear, 10% decay, 10% min efficiency
// With upgrades: 48h max, 16h linear, 5% decay, 20% min efficiency

class OfflineUpgradeManager {
  private upgrades: OfflineUpgrades;

  // What this does: Purchases an offline progression upgrade with Soul Power
  // Why this exists: Allows players to permanently improve their offline experience
  // How it integrates: Modifies the upgrade state and deducts Soul Power cost
purchaseUpgrade(upgradeType: keyof OfflineUpgrades, cost: number, soulPower: number):
boolean
{
    if (soulPower >= cost) {
      this.upgrades[upgradeType] += this.getUpgradeValue(upgradeType);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  // What this does: Calculates the cost of the next upgrade level
  // Why this exists: Provides clear progression goals and prevents infinite scaling
  // How it integrates: Used by the UI to display upgrade costs and availability
  getUpgradeCost(upgradeType: keyof OfflineUpgrades, currentLevel: number): number {
    // Example scaling: 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 Soul Power
    return 100 * Math.pow(2, Math.floor(currentLevel / 2));
  }
}

```text

#### Background Tick System

**What This Does:** Simulates the game's normal tick-based progression system while the player is offline, processing game logic in discrete time steps to maintain accuracy and consistency.

**Why This Exists:** Ensures that offline progression follows the same rules as online play, maintaining game balance and preventing exploits while providing realistic progress simulation.

**How It Integrates:** Works with the offline simulator to process game state changes over time, ensuring that offline progress is calculated using the same logic as active gameplay.

**Implementation Details:** Uses a tick-based approach where each tick represents 5 seconds of game time, with a maximum of 10 hours worth of ticks to prevent excessive calculations.

```typescript

class OfflineBackgroundTicker {
  private tickInterval: number = 5000; // 5 seconds
  private maxTicks: number = 7200;     // 10 hours worth of ticks
  private currentTick: number = 0;

  simulateBackgroundTicks(
    offlineMs: number,
    gameState: GameState
  ): BackgroundTickResult[] {
    const ticks: BackgroundTickResult[] = [];
    const totalTicks = Math.min(
      Math.floor(offlineMs / this.tickInterval),
      this.maxTicks
    );

    for (let i = 0; i < totalTicks; i++) {
      const tickTime = i * this.tickInterval;
      const tickResult = this.simulateTick(tickTime, gameState);
      ticks.push(tickResult);
      gameState = this.updateGameState(gameState, tickResult);
    }

    return ticks;
  }

  private simulateTick(tickTime: number, gameState: GameState): BackgroundTickResult {
    // Simulate enemy spawns, combat, progression
    const enemiesSpawned = this.simulateEnemySpawns(gameState);
    const combatResult = this.simulateCombat(enemiesSpawned, gameState);
    const progressionDelta = this.calculateProgressionDelta(combatResult);

    return {
      tickTime,
      enemiesSpawned,
      combatResult,
      progressionDelta,
      arcanaGained: combatResult.arcanaDrops
    };
  }
}

#### Integration with Progression Systems

**What This Does:** Defines how the divine favor system integrates with the game's progression systems, applying multipliers to various progression types (distance, Arcana, experience) when the blessing is active.

**Why This Exists:** Ensures that divine favor provides meaningful benefits across all progression systems while maintaining balanced gameplay and preventing exploitation.

**How It Integrates:** Works with the progression calculation systems to apply divine blessing multipliers to distance traveled, Arcana gained, and experience earned during active blessing periods.

**Implementation Details:** Uses a modifier pattern that wraps progression calculations with bonus multipliers, ensuring consistent application across all progression types.

```typescript

class DivineFavorProgressionModifier {
  constructor(private divineFavorSystem: DivineFavorSystem) {}

  applyDivineFavor(baseProgression: number, currentTime: number): number {
    this.divineFavorSystem.updateDivineFavor(currentTime);
    const multiplier = this.divineFavorSystem.getCurrentMultiplier();
    return baseProgression * multiplier;
  }

  applyDivineFavorToArcana(baseArcana: number, currentTime: number): number {
    this.divineFavorSystem.updateDivineFavor(currentTime);
    const multiplier = this.divineFavorSystem.getCurrentMultiplier();
    return Math.floor(baseArcana * multiplier);
  }
}

## üìö **Story 1.1.8: Draconia Tech Tree System Architecture**

### üéØ **What This Story Does** (5)

**For Non-Coders:** This story creates the foundation for the technology tree system that allows players to permanently upgrade their dragon's capabilities using Soul Power. Think of it like a skill tree in an RPG - players can unlock and upgrade different abilities across three main categories: Flamecraft (offensive abilities), Scales (defensive abilities), and Safety (utility and progression abilities). Each upgrade provides permanent benefits that persist across all journeys.

**Technical Summary:** Implement comprehensive tech tree system with database-driven node definitions, upgrade progression tracking, and integration with all existing upgrade systems. The system supports dynamic tree expansion and flexible upgrade mechanics.

## üìö **Story 1.1.7: Dual-Layer Enchantment System Architecture**

### üéØ **What This Story Does** (6)

**For Non-Coders:** This story creates the foundation for the enchantment system that will support both temporary upgrades (that reset each journey) and permanent upgrades (that players keep forever). Think of it like having both temporary power-ups and permanent character improvements. The system tracks both types separately so that when players return from a journey, their temporary upgrades reset but their permanent improvements stay.

**Technical Summary:** Implement dual-layer enchantment system with temporary journey levels (reset on return) and permanent starting levels (persist across journeys), including data structures, initialization logic, and reset mechanics.

### üîß **Technical Specifications** (9)

#### Core Data Structures

```typescript

// Enchantment system interfaces
interface EnchantLevels {
  firepower: number;  // Current level (upgradeable max)
  scales: number;     // Current level (upgradeable max)
  tier: number;       // Current tier (upgradeable max)
}

interface EnchantConfig {
  baseMaxFirepowerLevel: number;  // Base maximum firepower level (45, upgradeable)
  baseMaxScalesLevel: number;     // Base maximum scales level (45, upgradeable)
  baseMaxTier: number;            // Base maximum tier (upgradeable)
  baseArcanaCostPerLevel: number; // Base Arcana cost per level increase (upgradeable)
}

// What this does: Tracks enchantment system upgrades purchased with Soul Power
// Why this exists: Allows players to increase level caps, reduce costs, and improve
enchantment
effectiveness
through
meta-progression
// How it integrates: Modifies EnchantConfig values when calculating level limits and
upgrade
costs
interface EnchantmentUpgrades {
  // Level Cap Increases - Allow higher maximum levels
maxFirepowerBonus: number; // Additional maximum firepower levels (e.g., +10 levels)
  maxScalesBonus: number;         // Additional maximum scales levels (e.g., +10 levels)
  maxTierBonus: number;           // Additional maximum tiers (e.g., +5 tiers)

  // Cost Reductions - Reduce Arcana costs for upgrades
arcanaCostReduction: number; // Reduction to Arcana costs (0.0 = no reduction, 0.5 = 50%
reduction)

  // Effectiveness Bonuses - Improve enchantment power
firepowerEffectivenessBonus: number; // Additional effectiveness for firepower (0.0 = no
bonus,
0.25
=
+25%)
scalesEffectivenessBonus: number; // Additional effectiveness for scales (0.0 = no bonus,
0.25
=
+25%)

  // Permanent Level Bonuses - Start journeys with higher permanent levels
permanentLevelBonus: number; // Additional permanent starting levels (e.g., +5 levels to
all)
}

interface EnchantSystem {
  // Temporary levels that reset on journey end
  temporary: EnchantLevels;

  // Permanent starting levels (purchased with Soul Power)
  permanent: EnchantLevels;

  // Calculated effective levels for gameplay
  effective: EnchantLevels;
}

// What this does: Creates a system that tracks both temporary and permanent enchant
levels
// The effective levels are what actually affect gameplay (temporary + permanent)
// All level limits and costs are upgradeable through Soul Power purchases

```javascript

#### Journey Initialization

```typescript

class EnchantManager {
  private system: EnchantSystem;

  constructor(
    private config: EnchantConfig,
    private upgrades: EnchantmentUpgrades
  ) {}

  // What this does: Calculates effective enchantment configuration with upgrades applied
// Why this exists: Allows players to increase level caps, reduce costs, and improve
effectiveness
through
Soul
Power
purchases
  // How it integrates: Used by all enchantment calculations to apply upgrade bonuses
  private getEffectiveConfig(): EnchantConfig {
    return {
baseMaxFirepowerLevel: this.config.baseMaxFirepowerLevel +
this.upgrades.maxFirepowerBonus,
      baseMaxScalesLevel: this.config.baseMaxScalesLevel + this.upgrades.maxScalesBonus,
      baseMaxTier: this.config.baseMaxTier + this.upgrades.maxTierBonus,
baseArcanaCostPerLevel: this.config.baseArcanaCostPerLevel * (1 -
this.upgrades.arcanaCostReduction)
    };
  }

  initializeJourney(): void {
    const effectiveConfig = this.getEffectiveConfig();

    // Reset temporary levels to permanent starting levels (including permanent bonuses)
    this.system.temporary = {
firepower: Math.min(this.system.permanent.firepower + this.upgrades.permanentLevelBonus,
effectiveConfig.baseMaxFirepowerLevel),
scales: Math.min(this.system.permanent.scales + this.upgrades.permanentLevelBonus,
effectiveConfig.baseMaxScalesLevel),
tier: Math.min(this.system.permanent.tier + this.upgrades.maxTierBonus,
effectiveConfig.baseMaxTier)
    };
    this.updateEffectiveLevels();
  }

  private updateEffectiveLevels(): void {
    // Calculate effective levels (temporary + permanent) with effectiveness bonuses
    this.system.effective = {
firepower: Math.floor((this.system.temporary.firepower + this.system.permanent.firepower)
*
(1
+
this.upgrades.firepowerEffectivenessBonus)),
scales: Math.floor((this.system.temporary.scales + this.system.permanent.scales) * (1 +
this.upgrades.scalesEffectivenessBonus)),
      tier: Math.max(this.system.temporary.tier, this.system.permanent.tier)
    };
  }

// What this does: When starting a journey, temporary levels start at permanent levels
(including
upgrade
bonuses)
  // Then players can spend Arcana to increase temporary levels during the journey
  // All level limits and costs are affected by Soul Power upgrades
}

// What this does: Creates the manager that handles enchant initialization and updates
// When a journey starts, temporary levels are set to permanent starting levels
// During the journey, temporary levels can be increased with Arcana

```javascript

#### Journey Reset Logic

```typescript

class JourneyResetManager {
  resetEnchants(): void {
    // Reset temporary levels to permanent starting levels
    enchantManager.system.temporary = { ...enchantManager.system.permanent };
    enchantManager.updateEffectiveLevels();

    // Log the reset for telemetry
    telemetry.log('enchant_reset', {
      permanentLevels: enchantManager.system.permanent,
      arcanaSpent: this.calculateArcanaSpent()
    });
  }

// What this does: When returning to Draconia, temporary levels reset to permanent levels
  // This preserves the permanent upgrades while resetting temporary ones
}

// What this does: Handles the reset process when returning to Draconia
// Temporary levels go back to permanent starting levels
// Permanent levels remain unchanged

```javascript

#### Database Schema Updates

```typescript

// Updated profile schema to support dual-layer enchant system
export interface ProfileV1 {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // Temporary journey levels (reset on return)
  enchants: {
    firepower: number;
    scales: number;
    tier: number;
  };

  // Permanent starting levels (persist across journeys)
  enchantStartingLevels: {
    firepower: number;  // Current permanent level (upgradeable max)
    scales: number;     // Current permanent level (upgradeable max)
    tier: number;       // Current permanent tier (upgradeable max)
  };
}

// What this does: Extends the database schema to track both temporary and permanent
enchant
levels
// This allows the system to remember permanent upgrades between journeys
